The North Sea has long been an important incubator for innovation, research and
technology development. For decades, it has provided Norway with the oil and gas
that heats our homes, moves us around and powers our industrial development.

Europe with clean fuels and energy,” said Asgeir Tomasgard, Director of NTNU
Energy Transition Initiative, and a professor in the Department of Industrial Economics
and Technology Management at the university
